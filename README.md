# DeepMARL


## Project Goal

To implement mutiple-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by using distributed DQN agents to train in a dynamic, cooperative, and comptetitive grid environment.
The goal of each agent may be to survive, compete and accumulate reward, and as societies of agents compete and acculumate reward.


*Researched RL agents, specifically DQN variations and those utilizing a distributed architecture.
*Researched DQN taxonomy and composition using YouTube and example code.
*Researched various 'game-engines' that can be used with DQN agents: OpenAI Gym, PyGame.
*Researched environments, particularly Neural MMO, a massively multiagent game environment.
  * Think of a extremely basic MineCraft server, used to render terrain, agents, resources as a sort of sandbox environment.
*Implemented rudimentary single-agent using OpenAI polecart in order to familiarize with pilepine and relevant parameters.
*Ran through one example using polecart in order to familarize with the process and tf-agent module


Current Step:
*Run through second and distill process into my own implementation


The current plan is to:
- complete the above step
- implement RL on a frozen-lake envirionemnt
- tweak parameters, rewards, and actions
- 'port' my 'game' to one of the aforementioned 'game engines'


To Do's:
- Collect helpers, including saving and accessing agents
